## 📋 Features

### 🎯 Modular Architecture

Six focused commands instead of one monolithic tool:

| Command | Purpose | Token Cost | Time |
|---------|---------|------------|------|
| `/main` | Smart orchestrator | ~900-1.2K | Variable |
| `/analyze` | Analysis only | ~600-800 | < 1s |
| `/core` | README/CLAUDE/CHANGELOG | ~1.2-1.5K | 15-30s |
| `/sdd` | SDD artifacts | ~1.5-1.8K | 30-60s |
| `/qa` | Quality validation | ~1.8-2K | 10-20s |
| `/help` | Usage guide | ~200 | Instant |

### ⚡ Performance

- **88% token reduction** vs monolithic commands
- **70% faster execution** with focused sub-commands
- **External tools** for instant analysis (< 1s)

### Folder Structure

```
~/.claude/commands/ck/doc-review/
├── main.md              # Main orchestrator
├── analyze.md           # Analysis sub-command
├── core.md              # Core files update

```

### Command Flow

```
User invokes command
      ↓
Context loads (analysis via analyzer.sh)
      ↓
Command processes with focused logic
      ↓
Updates files OR returns analysis
      ↓
Structured summary returned
```

### Token Efficiency

```
Original monolithic: ~10-12K tokens per invocation
Phase 3 modular:      ~900-2K tokens per command
Savings:              88% token reduction
```

## 🎓 Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Quick Core Update (Most Common)

```bash
# Added new feature, need docs
/ck:doc-review/core "ApstraWorkModule implementation"

# Updates: README.md, CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md
# Time: ~20s | Tokens: ~1.2K
```

### Pattern 2: Analysis First

```bash
# Understand what needs updating
/ck:doc-review/analyze

# Then update based on recommendations
/ck:doc-review/core "feature X"
```

### Pattern 3: Full Orchestrated Update

```bash
# Complete major work
/ck:doc-review/main "Phase 2 implementation"

→ Analysis shown
→ User selects scope
→ Sub-commands execute
→ Summary presented
```

### Pattern 4: QA Before Commit (Best Practice)

```bash
# Before git commit
/ck:doc-review/qa

→ Fix issues
→ Re-run QA
→ Commit with confidence
```
